## What is this?????
This is the software...

This is the best PASCAL software that you've ever seen!

## But what do it do?
Right now, we are in the process of making the first iteration of the software, so it doesn't do anything really right now.

<br>
In the future, this code will control the PASCAL payload when it gets sent up into storms to measure the NOx released by lightning.
This program will use a target altitude and take six measurements, two a set distance below the target, 2 at the target, and 2 a set distance above the target.
The measurements will be taken by activating a pump and solenoid to fill bags with the surrounding air.

## Where to in the future?

In the future we plan to...
- [ ] Get it working
- [ ] Add a variable target altitude
- [ ] Win
