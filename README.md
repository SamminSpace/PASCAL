# PASCAL \(Payload for Atmospheric Sampling and Chemical Analysis from Lightning\)

## What is this?????
This is the software...

This is the best PASCAL software that you've ever seen!

## But what do it do?
This code, specifically the code in the `PASCAL` folder, controls the PASCAL UAH Space Hardware project. 
PASCAL studies the air around lightning strikes, specifically the amount of NO2 and NOx in the air given off by lightning.
As such, PASCAL needs to be able to sample the air at various altitudes during a thunderstorm, which is what this code controls.


## Features
- [ ] Scrubs, or cleans, the tubing with the pump before the sample is taken
    - Works, but will be updated for better logic soon
- [X] Sampling for a specified amount of time at variable altitudes
- [ ] Error Codes
    - Only very rudamentary ones at this point; on our payload we do not currently have LEDs to test with
    - Hopefully will be updated by the next flight
- [X] Controls flashing for external LEDs
- [ ] Dry runs solenoids before flight
    - Soon, we will have a checking sequence to ensure audibly that the solenoids for each sample are connected and working

## Last Flight 
July 19, 2025

## Next Flight
WHO KNOWS
When the rain gods decided to bless us with a storm
